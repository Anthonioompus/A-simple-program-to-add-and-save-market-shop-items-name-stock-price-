# Simple Market Inventory

A minimal command-line program to add and save market/shop items.  
This project demonstrates storing item data (name, stock, price) using a 2D array (or simple arrays), reading multi-word names with `getline()`, and printing a neat table-like output.

## Features
- Add item name (supports spaces), stock, and price
- Pretty-printed table output
- Simple, simple and simple
